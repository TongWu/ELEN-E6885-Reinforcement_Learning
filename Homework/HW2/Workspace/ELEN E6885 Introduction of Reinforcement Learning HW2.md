False

## Problem 2

### Part 1

The policy iteration use policy evaluation and policy improvement to process the optimisation. Two methods will each do an iteration until the policy is converged. Since each policy evaluation is started with the previous policy, so the speed of convergence will increased, which means use less iteration can get convergence. The value iteration include the Bellman optimality equation into the update rule and one policy evaluation.
